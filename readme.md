# Keyboard-Driven Workflows

## Karabiner
- caps lock to ctrl, esc when pressed
  - Caps lock sucks, easy access to Ctrl gives you the ability to actually USE the shortcuts here (otherwise why have them if you can't easily use them?)
- right command and ijkl or wasd to arrow keys (or hjkl for vim-style)

## iTerm Drop-Down
- Use one for general commands--you'll do this a lot more later, usually your commands now are project-based
- Use one for your project--just navigate to it.
- Use one for Node... really good way to investigate how JS works.

## Rectangle

- Ctrl-Option-Enter to go full-screen
- Ctrl-Option-arrow-keys to move monitors (goes well with right-command-arrow-keys Karabiner change!)
- Ctrl-Option-JKL to pick a third
- Ctrl-Option-H and Ctrl-Option-; to take up the first or last two thirds.

## Desktop-Based Task Splitting
- Command-Shift-F to make a fullscreen workspace
- Ctrl-arrow-keys to move workspaces
- Unfortunately, that's it for the keyboard here... No ability to:
  - Split workspaces by keyboard.
  - Rearrange workspaces by keyboard.
  - Move apps to different workspaces by keyboard.

## App-Based Task Splitting

- Cmd-Space to switch apps!
- I use like 7 browsers. Then each one can have a different task, like:
  - research
  - hosting local apps
  - Slack
  - Google Calendar (which I use a LOT)
  - Music (Spotify/YouTube/Pandora/Whatever cool people use now)
  - Personal browsing
  - Whatever else you want to be able to find quickly!

## Vimium Browser Extension

- Keyboard-based web browsing.
- It's in every  browser! (Mostly because they're all based on Google's open source Chromium)
- Goes really well with using multiple browsers--and the main reason I switched from desktop apps to browser apps!
  - Slack and Discord and Google Calendar and Gmail are often replaced by desktop apps, but you don't #have# to, and those apps usually have poor keyboard shortcuts.
- Basics:
  - f to follow a link
  - F to open a link in a new tab
  - j and k to go up and down (they are easy to hit with your strongest fingers, your right index and middle)
  - d and u to go a half-page up and down (configurable how much up or down they go)
  - J an K to switch tabs
  - \>\> and << to move tabs around
- TONS more
- highly configurable

## General text editing
- Option-left and Option-right to move by word
- Cmd-left and Cmd-right to move to start and end of line
- Shift with any of those to select, makes for easy deleting/replacing of text
- All easier if you have a Karabiner arrow key remapping!
- Option-delete to delete the word to the left, Option-Fn-Delete to delete the word the right

## VS Code Text Editing Shortcuts
- Option-up and Option-down to move lines up and down--easier with arrow keys!
- Shift-Option-up and Shift-Option-down to COPY lines up and down.
- Shift-Option-up and Shift-Option-down to COPY lines up and down.
  - Great to do once, and then move the line around with Option-up/Option-down!
- Command-Shift-K to delete your current line.

## VS Code Workflow Shortcuts
- Command-Shift-P to run almost any command.
- Command-B to show/hide the file explorer.
- Command-P to find and open a file.
